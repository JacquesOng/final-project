      <h1>Fracking</h1>
      <p>What is fracking? </p>
      
      <p>After the industrial revolution, the amount of energy we use is a lot more. Most of this energy is from fossil fuels. Fracking is also called hydraulic fracturing. It describes the recovery of natural gas from the Earth. Fractured through the use of water, sand and chemicals. These three are used to release the gas stuck. This isn't really a popular thing that people talk about yet many countries use them. Mainly being used to extract oil, natural gas, geothermal power and water from the ground.</p>

        <p>A shaft digs several hundred meters in the Earth. It then digs horizontally in the gas bearing part of the rock. The fluid is pumped into the ground using high performance pumps. The fluid usually consists of 8 million liters of water. This is enough to supply 65,000 people plus several tons of sand and about 200,000 liters of chemicals. This mixture penetrates into the rock layer creating many cracks. The sand stops the cracks from closing again. The chemicals can press the water, kill bacteria or dissolve minerals. The majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again. Lastly, the natural gas can be recovered. After the gas source is exhausted, the hole is sealed. The fracking liquid is sealed in there.</p>

        <p> Fracking is a very good way to get energy, but there are still disadvantages. </p>

      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <p>The advantage of Fracking is being able to collect gas which can be used as energy. This in the short term can be good to power low energy items. However, in the long term, it is also very bad for the environment and even poses a risk to us. </p>

      <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
      <p>On the other hand, The disadvantages of Fracking are that it takes up a lot of energy and when it recovers gas from underground, 3 percent of it escapes. This may not seem bad at first however the gas that it recovers from underground is the greenhouse gas, methane which is 25 times worse than carbon dioxide. Another bad thing is that the process of fracking can contaminate our drinking sources and that can be very harmful to us.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>Fracking is a useful way in getting oil, natural gas and other things from the depths of the Earth. It still comes with it's disadvantages. However, it seems like it's a wonderful way to get these things, but we have to remember that the disadvantages exist. These may range from minor to brutal. Some of the super bad ones are that it could let some gas out, these gases are greenhouse gases, methane to be exact which is a lot worse that carbon dioxide and it contaminates our drinking sources which if people were to drink from, would cause them to get very sick and could risk their death.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, I would say that we shouldn't really use this. We can use other ways to get energy like solar and wind. There are solutions to problems awaiting to be discovered, so right now let's take care of our world!</p>
